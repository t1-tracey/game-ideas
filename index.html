    Child playing in the fields, when her mother comes out and calls for lunch. Both their red eyes shining like rubies, and hair like snow.
  </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Child gets bullied at school because of her eyes and hair. "Witch, demon" they called after her.
</p>
<p>
  Child comes Home in dirt and bruises and scratches. A girl with fancy clothes and golden hair, is the leader of the bullies.
</p>

Her mother treats to her wounds, and she says that it all alright. Her mother says about how much she loves the child's eyes, like rubies, pure snow

. She uses healing magic with a chant, and bright beautiful light makes all her hurting go away.

Just like her father's. And the crying child stops.

She accepts and forgives the bullies, just like what her father would have done.

The child smiles " when I grow up I want to be a cleric just like mama and papa !"

Child rambles on, not noticing her mother's smile drop.

Clerics were thought as useless, and gets treated unfairly.
